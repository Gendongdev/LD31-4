- UI:
	- main game screen
	- right side: 
		- selected unit
		- actions
	- bottom - count-down to next event

- gameplay:
	- no mans land at the top
	- dig
	- gun placements
	- reinforcements
	- units can't be directly controlled
		- different types of agents:
			- 
- enemy is at top of screen

- fires randomly:
	- machine gun fire - straight line - only hits people out of trenches - reduces morale of those in trenches
	- shells/mortars - destroys structures, injures people in trenches

	- shell attacks are weighted towards the top of the screen

victory: get some number of troops over the op

troops:
	- simple agents
	- two stats: HP and morale
	- when HP = 0, they die
		- reduced by being hit
	- when morale = 0, they flee off bottom of map
		- move more slowly as morale drops
	- some mechanism to repair each?
	- they'll take jobs, ie build trench, build gun emplacements, etc etc
		- take closes?
	- pathfinding: can pathfind outside of trenches, but more vulnerable - prefer in trenches as much as possible


TODO:

- pathfinding for troops - stay in trenches as much as possible
	- graph update: take into account penalty
		- trench 0
		- others 1000
		- buildings - unwalkable - eventually

- mortars - destroy structures, lots of damage to soliders
- do more with morale:
	- if drops to zero, flee to random point off the map - can still fall while fleeing
	- once off map, regain points then come back

- win condition
- lose condition
	- all soldiers dead or fleeing?
