TODO:

- other player constructions, with resultant UI
	- walls
		- have a large number of hit points
		- stop machine gun fire - from both directions!
		- can't be crossed by troops
	- machine gun - supress enemy fire
		- no mortars from a column where a machine gun has shot a bullet in last N seconds
	- mortar
		- if it collides with an enemy mortar, both destroyed in mid air (no damage?)
		- each mortar over the top shortens current enemy fire period or adds delay
	- sentry
		- troop stays where it is for N ticks
	- medic:
		- heal HP (and morale???) of each unit in a certain radius

- gun, mortar, medic will all be constant jobs, for as long as the building stands

- more sophisticated enemy fire:
	- waves of machine gun fire and mortar fire
		- some randomness

- win condition
	- over the top
		- some number of soldiers have to make it over within a period of time

- lose condition
	- all soldiers dead or fleeing?

- current white box in the UI will have the following information:
	- number of active troops
	- number of fleeing troops
	- number of troops over the top
	- active # of jobs???	
	
- real art
- music
- sound
- animations

- particle effects - yea/nay











- UI:
	- main game screen
	- right side: 
		- selected unit
		- actions
	- bottom - count-down to next event

- gameplay:
	- no mans land at the top
	- dig
	- gun placements
	- reinforcements
	- units can't be directly controlled
		- different types of agents:
			- 
- enemy is at top of screen

- fires randomly:
	- machine gun fire - straight line - only hits people out of trenches - reduces morale of those in trenches
	- shells/mortars - destroys structures, injures people in trenches

	- shell attacks are weighted towards the top of the screen

victory: get some number of troops over the op

troops:
	- simple agents
	- two stats: HP and morale
	- when HP = 0, they die
		- reduced by being hit
	- when morale = 0, they flee off bottom of map
		- move more slowly as morale drops
	- some mechanism to repair each?
	- they'll take jobs, ie build trench, build gun emplacements, etc etc
		- take closes?
	- pathfinding: can pathfind outside of trenches, but more vulnerable - prefer in trenches as much as possible
